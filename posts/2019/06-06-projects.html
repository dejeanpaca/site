<p>
    I've wanted to create a new site for myself and my projects, and it took a while to get it rolling.
</p>
<p>
    Made a simple <a href="https://github.com/dejeanpaca/site-generator" target="_blank">generator</a> in php to generate my site and the contents as mostly static html, and minimalistic css and maybe a bit of js someday. It's sufficient for a simple blog like site. Subject to further improvements.
</p>
<p>
    Also rolled out my <a href="https://github.com/dejeanpaca/oxcart" target="_blank">oxcart</a> engine out to github a while ago. Will post any significant updates here.
</p>
