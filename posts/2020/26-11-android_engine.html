<p>
    Somewhat got my engine ported to android, to further the functionality of it. One goal was to be able to
    swap between apps and have my game engine continue running normally.
</p>
<p>
    This is a bit more complex, since android destroys and recreates your native window when it loses focus, and also destroys the egl surface.
</p>
<p>
    Simple task, recrate the surface and the existing egl contexts should remain working with the new surface. Alas, no.
    In the process I missed an important function call while sifting various reference code on the interwebs. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Got this error message when trying to do a <code>eglSwapBuffers</code>:<br/>
</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <code>queueBuffer: error queuing buffer to SurfaceTexture, -19</code>
</div>

<p>
    Googling the error message yielded nothing useful, or nothing I've already not done. And there seemed to be nothing
    specific about the <code>-19</code> part. It resulted in a maddening trial and error. And I knew it had to work,
    cause other engines/games do it properly.
</p>

<p>
    At last found out I was missing a call to <code>ANativeWindow_setBuffersGeometry()</code>.
</p>

<p>
    When you swap back to your app, for some reason the buffer geometry is different than it was, and you have to set it
    to match the egl config by getting the format.
</p>
<div class="code-block">
    <code>
    eglGetConfigAttrib(egl_display, egl_config, EGL_NATIVE_VISUAL_ID, @format);
    ANativeWindow_setBuffersGeometry(app^.window, 0, 0, format);
    </code>
</div>

<p>
    <small-header/>In a nutshell for anyone doing it themselves like me.<br/><br/>

    Do all the operations in the android_main() loop. First initialize the egl display, and find a config.
    Setup the buffer geometry, then create surface and contexts. On loss of surface (destroyed window), only recreate the surface without destroying
    your contexts and you can swap apps without having to reload textures.
