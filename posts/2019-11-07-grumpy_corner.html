<p>
A new <a href="/pages/grumpy.html">grumpy corner section</a> was added to the site.
</p>

<p>
Inspiredy by <a href="https://grumpy.site">grumpy.site</a>, it's a collection of posts that annoy me about software, hardware,
life and other things, but mostly the first two.
</p>

<p>
Some improvements had to be made to the site generator and the site itself before this was implemented.
