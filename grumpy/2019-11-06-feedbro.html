Opening the Feedbro toolbar menu in Firefox every second (odd) time always results in a broken menu which doesn't load completely.
<br/><br/>
May be due to update to FF 70, but other addons don't experience such issues. Luckily, a workaround (click it again) makes this mostly an annoyance, as it's a quite useful addon for me.

Quite odd
