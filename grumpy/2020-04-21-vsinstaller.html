<p>
    Apart from VS needing to update the installer every time there's an update, 
    apparently in 2020 we can't have download resume.     
</p>
<p>
    Since my shitty wifi usb adapter tended to reset every 2 minutes, the VS installer would reset 
    package download back to start instead of resuming. I've not been able to download VS because resuming a 
    download is apparently impossible in 2020.

    And, the tooltip for the "provide feedback" button won't go away.
