    When I leave this to download from the Google Drive, the phone screen will lock eventually because the internet connection is slow 
    (and takes around 10 minutes which I'm not gonna spend looking at the phone screen).
    And if it does, when the download finishes it won't ask you what you want to do, the pop up will be gone.

You have to keep the screen on when it finishes downloading, so you can install. And of course, the package won't be stored in Downloads for maximum inconvencience.

    Maybe it's related to me running Pixel Experience on my phone, but seems google drive related. Still, a bad show.
